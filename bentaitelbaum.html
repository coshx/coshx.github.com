		<h2>Ben Taitelbaum</h2>
		<h3>code monkey, agile evangelist, puzzle solver</h3>
		<p><span class="drop-cap">A</span>lmost two decades ago, twelve-year-old Ben reproduced the classic computer game Nibbles, providing hours of riveting entertainment. Since then, he has never strayed from manipulating technology for the benefit of its users. Having spent the last three years as the founder of a start-up company and then forming Coshx Labs, Ben is always on the lookout for meaningful, game-changing ideas! When he is not busy attempting to change the world, he may be found scaling the ascents of the Blue Ridge Mountains or serenading to the tunes of musicians from Josh Ritter to Johannes Brahms on his trusty violin.</p>
