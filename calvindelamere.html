		<h2>Calvin Delamere</h2>
		<h3>Software Engineer</h3>
		<p><span class="drop-cap">C</span>alvin started programming as a freshman in high school in 2002 and build and deployed his first website in 2003. He has programmed in more languages than he has fingers but in the last few years he has focused his computer science and applied math background on web app development. In his free time, Calvin enjoys spending time in the mountains with friends. Calvin also enjoys crushing the competition at foosball on the company table.</p>
